# weather-app

This is a simple weather app built for The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app).

The project was to give us experience with API's and learn about asynchronous programming within javascript.

The app makes a request to visual crossing's weather API then uses the data received to populate the page.
